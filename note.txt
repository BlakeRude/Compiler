Pretty sure all my errors stem from 'scoping' issues

for example, my program doesnt like

example(int i)
{
    {
        int i;
    }
}

and says that symbol i has already been declared

I hypothesized today that it is because I'm using SymbolTable::lookup instead of SymbolTable::instert when deciding if something is declared or not
gonna see if thats the case, but didn't have time before the deadline
